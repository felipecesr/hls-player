# Custom HLS Player Project

This repository contains a simple, event-driven HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) player written in JavaScript. The project was originally created as a study exercise to better understand how video streaming players work, inspired by the [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) library.

##Features

ðŸ›  **Event-Driven Architecture:** Built using an event-based communication model for modular and flexible design.

ðŸŽ¥ **HLS Streaming:** Supports parsing .m3u8 playlists and fetching video chunks.

ðŸ”Œ **Media Source Extensions (MSE):** Handles dynamic loading and buffering of video segments.

âš¡ **Modern Development Setup:** Uses [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast bundling and development.
